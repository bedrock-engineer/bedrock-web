The community of Bedrock has its home in the SWUNG (Software Underground) community.

However, because Bedrock also has a strong link with Speckle - to make it possible to use ground investigation easily in all the software that are commonly used in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering & Construction) industry - you may want to post your questions on the Speckle community forum.
