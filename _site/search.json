    "text": "Goals\nThe overarching goal of Quarto is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nCreate a writing and publishing environment with great integrated tools for technical content. We want to make authoring with embedded code, equations, figures, complex diagrams, interactive widgets, citations, cross references, and the myriad other special requirements of scientific discourse straightforward and productive for everyone.\nHelp authors take full advantage of the web as a connected, interactive platform for communications, while still providing the ability to create excellent printed output from the same document source. Researchers shouldn‚Äôt need to choose between LaTeX, MS Word, and HTML but rather be able to author documents that target all of them at the same time.\nMake reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception. Reproducibility requires that the code and data required to create a manuscript are an integrated part of it. However, this isn‚Äôt often straightforward in practice‚ÄîQuarto aims to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow than not.\n\nQuarto is open source software. We believe that it‚Äôs better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."

    "text": "Static Code, Computed Code & Interactivity\nA Quarto Website project produces HTML documents (see _site directory) as output from the Quarto (.qmd), Markdown (.md), or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files, which are then put together into a website with all the features a modern (docs) site needs by Quarto. Code blocks in these HTML documents comes in 2 types:\n\nStatic Code. Static code is not executed by Quarto when the website is generated, and can therefore not produce output such as figures. Static code blocks can be generated like this:\n  ```{.python}\n  print(\"This is a static code block. The code in this block will not be executed.\")\n  ```\nResult üëá\n\nprint(\"This is a static code block. The code in this block will not be executed.\")\n\nComputed Code. Computed code is executed by Quarto when the website it generated, and can therefore produce output such as figures. These figures can also be made interactive when you use a library such as plotly. Computed code blocks can be generated like this:\n  ```{python}\n  print(\"This is a computed code block. The code block will be executed.\")\n  ```\nResult üëá\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"This is a computed code block. The code block will be executed.\")\n\n\nThis is a computed code block. The code block will be executed.\n\n\nAs you can see, this is a bit tricky, because the difference between a code block being static ({.python}) and computed ({python}) is only a single ‚Äú.‚Äù.\nBelow a little more exciting example of a computed Python code block. Figure¬†1 actually comes from Quarto‚Äôs Get Started Guide.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: A line plot on a polar axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Annotations\nQuarto also has beatiful code annotations:\n{\n  \"location\": {\n    \"attributes\": {},\n1    \"geometry\": \"Point / 3D LineString\",\n    \"children\": {}\n  }\n}\n\n1\n\nThe geometry of a borehole location is best represented by a ‚Äú3D LineString‚Äù. However, when visualizing the locations for which GI data is available on a 2D map, vertical lines vanish, in such cases using ‚ÄúPoint‚Äù geometry for the GI location is better."

    "text": "Under Construction üèóÔ∏è\n\n\n\nThis page of Bedrock‚Äôs website is still under construction. The content below comes from Quarto‚Äôs FAQ page. Most links on this page are broken.\n\n\n\nWhat can I use Quarto for?\nQuarto¬Æ is an open source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more.\n\n\nHow do I install Quarto?\nVisit the Quarto.org - Get Started page, which provides installation instructions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\n\n\nIs Quarto free to use?\nYes! Quarto is open source. Quarto version 1.3 (and earlier) is licensed under the GNU GPL v2. Quarto version 1.4 is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n\nWhat output formats can Quarto create?\nThere are many output formats available in Quarto. This includes all of the built in Pandoc formats (e.g.¬†HTML, PDF, MS Word, Revealjs, ePub, etc.) as well as various ways to publish multiple documents (websites, blogs, and books). Learn more at Quarto Formats.¬†\n\n\nWhat editing tools can I use with Quarto?\nYou can use a wide variety of tools with Quarto. We have provided documentation for writing and editing Quarto documents in VSCode, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, or any text editor. Visit the Get Started with Quarto page to install, and then choose your tool for a brief introductory guide.\n\n\nCan I use Jupyter notebooks with Quarto?\nYes! Quarto can render Jupyter notebooks and you can use Jupyter, JupyterLab or any other .ipynb notebook editor with Quarto. You can render existing .ipynb notebooks as-is with Quarto, but adding Quarto-specific output options or a YAML header can enhance the output. Visit theJupyterLab page for more information.\n\n\nWhat programming languages are supported in Quarto?\nThe principal languages supported by Quarto are Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript. Integration with Jupyter also enables the use of many other languages.¬†\nEach Quarto document can be optionally processed by a computational engine (the engine can be manually specified or automatically detected based on the code chunks within). Current engines include Knitr (which is also used by R Markdown and supports a variety of languages including R, Python, and Julia, etc.) and Jupyter (which supports many languages including Python, Julia, and R). See the documentation on Engine Binding for additional details.\n\n\nWhat human languages are supported in Quarto?\nYou can write your Quarto documentation in your human language of choice. The lang document option is used to identify the main language of the document using IETF language tags (following the BCP 47 standard), such as en or en-GB.¬†\n\n\nCan I use Quarto to develop proprietary content?\nYes! The copyright on Quarto does not cover the original content that you generate using Quarto. Using Quarto to create original content does not place any restrictions, legally, on the license that you choose for the original content that you create, nor does it ‚Äúreach through‚Äù to affect software that you might be writing documentation for with Quarto.\n\n\nBut doesn‚Äôt the GPL cover exported HTML documents when they include styles or functionalities from Quarto?\nIt covers the styles or functionalities themselves. It does not cover your original content because your original content is not a derivative work of the Quarto styles or functionalities.\n\n\nHow can I share documents and have people comment on them?\nYou can publish Quarto content to various locations. See the user guides for publishing for details on using Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Posit Connect, and other services with Quarto. Once documents are published you can use¬† hypothes.is, Utterances, or Giscus for commenting. Learn more in the documentation on commenting.\n\n\nCan I do collaborative editing with Quarto?\nThere is not yet anything specific for collaborative editing in Quarto. You can collaborate on .qmd files in the same way you currently do for any text or code files.¬†\nPosit Workbench allows for Project Sharing for interactive editing and collaboration on the same document.\n\n\nWhere can I publish Quarto websites?\nThere are a wide variety of ways to publish Quarto websites. Website content is by default written to the \\_site sub-directory (you can customize this using the output-dir option). Publishing is simply a matter of copying the output directory to a web server or web hosting service.\nThe publishing documentation describes several convenient options for Quarto website deployment including Posit Connect, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Firebase, Site44, and Amazon S3. We‚Äôll mostly defer to the documentation provided by those various services, but will note any Quarto website specific configuration required.\n\n\nDoes Posit Connect support Quarto?\nYes! You can publish Quarto content to Posit Connect v2021.08.0 or later. Quarto has to be enabled as documented in the Posit Connect admin guide. Connect‚Äôs user documentation refers to Quarto.org docs on how to publish from the RStudio IDE. To publish Python-based Quarto content, you can use the rsconnect-python CLI from various locations, including VSCode, JupyterLab or the terminal.\n\n\nWho are the developers of Quarto?\nDevelopment of Quarto is sponsored by Posit, PBC. The same core team works on both Quarto and R Markdown:\n\nCarlos Scheidegger (@cscheid)\nCharles Teague (@dragonstyle)\nChristophe Dervieux (@cderv)\nJ.J. Allaire (@jjallaire)\nYihui Xie (@yihui)\n\nHere is the full contributors list. Quarto is open source and we welcome contributions in our github repository as well! https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli.\n\n\nWhy the name Quarto?\nWe wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing and landed on Quarto, which is the format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves. The earliest known European printed book is a Quarto, the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Johannes Gutenberg in 1452‚Äì53.\n\n\nWhere can I report bugs or request features?\nThanks for finding something and sharing with us! You can file an issue in the Quarto repository https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues.\n\n\nWhere can I ask questions and discuss using Quarto with others?\nThe best place to ask questions and see what questions other people have is in Quarto discussions (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions)."
