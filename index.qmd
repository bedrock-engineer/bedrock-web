Bedrock is an open-source Python library for reading & writing Ground Investigation data in different formats.

## 📖 Read / write Ground Investigation (GI) data in different formats

Ground Investigation data is often stored in specialized file formats that are not easily accessible for modern (geospatial) analysis and visualization workflows.
Bedrock transforms GI data from file formats into structured data, making it accessible for a wide range of applications.

| Data Format | Read | Write |
|-------------|------|-------|
| AGS 3       | ✅  | ❌    |
| AGS 4       | ✅  | ✅    |
| Excel       | ✅  | ✅    |
| CSV         | ✅  | ✅    |
| JSON        | ✅  | ✅    |
| GeoJSON     | ✅  | ✅    |

Do you need another format? [DIGGS](https://diggsml.org/)? [NADAG](https://www.ngu.no/geologisk-kartlegging/om-nadag-nasjonal-database-grunnundersokelser)? [GEF](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/STREAM/Dutch+National+GEF+Standards)? Something else?

## ✅ Validate your GI data

`bedrock-gi` comes with data validation to make sure that you can combine Ground Investigation data from multiple files into a single GIS database with consistent relationships between GI locations, samples, in-situ measurements and lab tests.

This data validation mechanism (based on [`pandera`](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) is easily extensible, giving you the power to add your own data validation criteria 💪

## 🗺️ Put your GI data from multiple files into a single 3D GIS database

For example, you can take GI data from 100 AGS files and combine them into a single a [GeoPackage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage) ([like a Shapefile, but waaay better](http://switchfromshapefile.org/)).

A GeoPackage can then be loaded into QGIS or ArcGIS, such that you can visualize your GI data in 3D, and perform analyses:

## 🟦 Put your GI data into Speckle

Once you have your GI data inside [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/), it's super easy to visualize GI data together with civil engineering designs:

</p>

Moreover, your GI data becomes available in all the software that [Speckle has connectors for](https://www.speckle.systems/connectors).

## 🔓 Free and Open Source Software

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) gives you full access to the code, which means you can customize `bedrock-gi` to integrate with other tools and fit your workflows & project needs.

As the name implies, FOSS is free to use, so you're not tied to expensive software licenses or locked into a specific software vendor ⛓️‍💥

You can give [feedback](#-feedback) and [contribute](#-contributing), such that together we together can build the tools we've always wanted and needed 🤝
