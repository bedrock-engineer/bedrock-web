## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

In case you're using `uv`, you can add `bedrock-gi` to your Python project and install it in your project's virtual environment by running:

```bash
uv add bedrock-gi
```

I would highly recommend anyone to start using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Unified Virtual Environment Manager) if you're not already doing so. Some of the advantages (Source: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

- üñ•Ô∏è `uv` Python projects will work on Windows, macOS and Linux.
- üêç `uv` [installs and manages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#python-management) Python versions.
- üóÇÔ∏è `uv` provides [comprehensive project management](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#project-management), with a [universal lockfile](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#project-lockfile). This means no more headaches about virtual environments (or having to explain what on earth a virtual env is), or people running different versions of Python or Python packages on the same project, causing errors and other problems.
- In short, üöÄ `uv` is a single tool to replace `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `virtualenv`, `conda` and more...

It's of course also possible to install `bedrock-gi` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bedrock-gi/) (Python Packaging Index) using `pip`:

```bash
pip install bedrock-gi
```
