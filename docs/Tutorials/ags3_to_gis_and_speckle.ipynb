    "Kai Tak is a neighborhood in Kowloon, Hong Kong. One of the highlights of Kai Tak used to be it's airport, which holds a special place in aviation history due to its unique and challenging approach, which involved pilots making a steep descent over a densely populated area while making a sharp turn at the same time and then landing on a single runway that jutted out into Victoria Harbor.\n",

    "In 1998 the new Hong Kong International Airport opened, and operations at Kai Tak Airport were ceased. After the closure, the former Kai Tak Airport and surrounding neighborhood underwent a massive redevelopment project to transform it into a new residential and commercial district, which is still continuing today.\n",
